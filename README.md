### Gibberish Checker
---
The Gibberish Checker is a Python script that analyzes a given text and computes a score between 0 and 1, indicating how much of the text consists of valid English words. The score is calculated by comparing the words in the input text against a predefined dictionary of English words. A higher score indicates a higher proportion of valid English words, while a lower score suggests the presence of more gibberish or non-English words.

This tool is useful for basic text validation or evaluating text quality in simple scenarios. The program takes the input text directly from the command line, processes it, and outputs the gibberish score.
